# WiFi-Controlled-Line-Follower-Robot-ESP32-
This project uses an 8-channel line tracking sensor and is controlled through a built-in ESP32 web server.
The system reads real-time line detection data, applies PID control for smooth tracking, and allows users to remotely operate or monitor the robot via a responsive web interface.
